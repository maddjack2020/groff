 This file provides macros for addition, multiplication, and division
 of 62-bit signed integers.  Its main application is to 'scale'
 31-bit values--namely, to perform the operation 'a * b / c'
 accurately.

 Note that it is the duty of the user to check whether the input
 values fit within 31 bits (this is the range
 [-1073741824,1073741823]).

 Tracing within groff means replacing the original macros or requests
 with special versions which act as wrappers to emit tracing
 information.  A natural consequence of creating such wrappers is
 that arguments must be expanded once more.  In most cases it doesn't
 matter, however, sometimes it makes a difference.
 .
 To limit side effects, only macros are traced by default, together
 with some requests like '.return' which don't take (user) arguments.
 If you want more tracing, especially of number and string register

 This script is derived from GIT-VERSION-GEN from GIT: https://git-scm.com/.
 It may be run two ways:
 - from a git repository in which the "git describe" command below
 produces useful output (thus requiring at least one signed tag)
 - from a non-git-repo directory containing a .tarball-version file, which
 presumes this script is invoked like "./git-version-gen .tarball-version".
 .
 In order to use intra-version strings in your project, you will need two
 separate generated version string files:
 .
 .tarball-version - present only in a distribution tarball, and not in
 a checked-out repository.  Created with contents that were learned at
 the last time autoconf was run, and used by git-version-gen.  Must not
 be present in either $(srcdir) or $(builddir) for git-version-gen to
 give accurate answers during normal development with a checked out tree,
 but must be present in a tarball when there is no version control system.
 Therefore, it cannot be used in any dependencies.  GNUmakefile has
 hooks to force a reconfigure at distribution time to get the value
 correct, without penalizing normal development with extra reconfigures.
 .
 .version - present in a checked-out repository and in a distribution
 tarball.  Usable in dependencies, particularly for files that don't
 want to depend on config.h but do want to track version changes.
 Delete this file prior to any autoconf run where you want to rebuild
 files to pick up a version string change; and leave it stale to
 minimize rebuild time after unrelated changes to configure sources.
 .
 As with any generated file in a VC'd directory, you should add
 /.version to .gitignore, so that you don't accidentally commit it.
 .tarball-version is never generated in a VC'd directory, so needn't
 be listed there.
 .
 Use the following line in your configure.ac, so that $(VERSION) will
 automatically be up-to-date each time configure is run (and note that
 since configure.ac no longer includes a version string, Makefile rules
 should not depend on configure.ac for version updates).

 Last update: 1994-03-03 (March 3, 1994).
 Revision history:
 1991-01-08: First version available for anonymous FTP.
 1991-08-08: Changed \aa to \aa0 at end of line, to stop TeX from
 concatenating the patterns.
 1991-09-03: Cleaned up lots of inconsistencies in the dictionary.
 As a consequence, the patterns shrunk a lot.  Also
 added some 4000 one-syllable words, some of which were
 hyphenated by the old patterns, and some 1500 compound
 words, about half of which were incorrectly hyphenated
 by the old patterns.
 1991-11-01: Added another some 6200 compound words, all of which were
 incorrectly hyphenated by the old patterns.
 1991-11-13: Added another some 6500 compound words, all of which were
 incorrectly hyphenated by the old patterns.
 1992-01-30: Changed macros to ^^, for use with LaTeX and dc fonts.
 1994-03-03: The hyphenated dictionary now contains about 118,000
 words.  The hyphenation now works much better for compound
 words.  Patgen parameters: 1 2 20, 2 1 8, 1 4 7, 3 2 1, 1
 10000 4.
 .
 This file contains Swedish hyphenation patterns for TeX.  It assumes
 that you have fonts with the Swedish letters in the positions where
 they occur in ISO Latin 1 (ISO 8859/1):
 Letter:   \AA  \"A  \"O  \'E  \aa  \"a  \"o  \'e
 Position: "C5  "C4  "D6  "C9  "E5  "E4  "F6  "E9
 .
 Load this file into initex after plain.tex (or lplain.tex, splain.tex,
 or whatever).
 .
 The patterns were generated in such a way that they will hyphenate

 Steve Kirkendall has thoughtfully reworked elvis's syntax
 highlighting so that it now supports nroff constructs like \fBword
 and \(emword, with \fB and \(em being highlighted while "word" is
 not.
 .
 There are some other enhancements as well, making it possible
 to have any word beginning with punctuation (i.e. groff
 requests) highlighted.  I've decided to take advantage of these
 improvements, which apply to elvis-2.2h onwards, and write a new
 simplified set of syntax highlighting rules for mom.  Just plug
 this file at the end of /etc/elvis/elvis.syn to use them.
 .
 If you're using an older version of elvis, stick with the

 but defers to any gnulib snprintf replacements.  Therefore, gnulib
 must guarantee that the decision for replacing snprintf is a superset

 This information supplements the generic installation instructions in
 the file 'INSTALL'.  It is meant for people building from the
 development repository, rather than a distribution archive.
 Distribution archives include a 'configure' script, among other files;
 the repository does not.  If you want to start building the 'groff'
 system using an existing 'configure' script, you don't need the
 information in this file.

 but defers to any gnulib vsnprintf replacements.  Therefore, gnulib
 must guarantee that the decision for replacing vsnprintf is a superset
 of the reasons checked by libintl.

 .
 Various directories contain a "tests" subdirectory.  These are automated
 tests performed when groff's Makefile is run with the "check" target.
 .
 3) Documentation
 .
 groff documentation is spread throughout the tree; where possible, it is
 close to the source code it describes.
 .
 - The top-level directory contains text files presenting groff as a
 software project, with its focus on organization of the code,
 development procedures, and project administration.
 .
 If you don't know where to begin, start with "README"; it contains the
 information you will require to obtain the groff distribution archive,
 report bugs, and contact the developers.
 .
 - A man page for each program (for section 1 of the manual) is
 maintained in the source directory of the program itself.
 .
 - Extensive man pages documenting GNU roff's input language, special
 character repertoire, differences from AT&T troff, device and font
 description file formats, macro files, and historical and conceptual
 background are maintained in the "man" directory.
 .
 - Documentation in other formats is located in the "doc" directory,
 including groff's Texinfo manual, and tutorial and/or reference
 manuals written using groff macro packages.
 .
 - Documentation for contributed components is kept in the relevant
 subdirectory of "contrib".
 .
 4) groff language parser
 .
 The "troff" program in "src/roff/troff" parses the groff input language.
 There, "input.cpp" implements the main loop and tokenizes input.  Input
 tokens are transformed into nodes (a GNU troff internal data structure)
 by "env.cpp" and "node.cpp".  Routines in the latter file generate the
 page description language from lists of nodes.
 .
 5) page description language parser
 .
 The parser for the page description language produced by troff is
 implemented in "src/libs/libdriver/input.cpp".  This is used by all
 groff output drivers written in C++.  ("gropdf", written in Perl,
 performs its own parsing.)

 This is the 'groff' document formatting system, a reimplementation and
 extension of the AT&T Unix 'troff' system.  The version number is given
 in the file '.tarball-version' if you are building from a distribution
 archive; otherwise, building from its Git repository will store it in
 the file '.version'.
 .
 This release includes original implementations (not derived from AT&T
 Unix code) of the 'troff', 'nroff', 'pic', 'eqn', 'tbl', 'refer', and
 'soelim' programs; the 'man' and 'ms' macro packages; and output drivers
 for PostScript, PDF, and TeX DVI file formats, HP LaserJet 4- and Canon
 CaPSL-compatible printers, HTML and XHTML (in beta status), and
 typewriter/terminal devices.
 .
 It also provides modified versions of BSD Unix additions to Unix troff:
 the 'grn' preprocessor, and the 'mdoc' and 'me' macro packages.
 'gxditview', an enhanced version of the X11 'xditview' previewer for
 'troff' device-independent output, originates from X11R5.
 .
 Contributed components feature a reimplementation and extension of the
 DWB 'troff' 'mm' macro package by Joergen Haegg, Peter Schaffter's 'mom'
 macro package, and Bernd Warken's reimplementation of the 'chem'
 preprocessor in Perl.
 .
 See the file 'INSTALL.extra' for instructions on how to install from a
 distribution archive, such as a release, beta, or release candidate.
 .
 The file 'INSTALL.REPO' contains supplementary instructions for building
 directly from a clone of the Git repository.
 .
 The file 'NEWS' contains a history of user-visible changes to 'groff'.
 .
 'groff' is free software.  See the file 'COPYING' for copying
 permissions, and 'LICENSES' for further detail.
 .
 The file 'PROBLEMS' describes various issues that users have encountered
 in compiling, installing, and running 'groff'.
 .
 The file 'MORE.STUFF' describes some third-party programming and
 documentary resources useful with 'groff'.
 .
 Current and historical releases of 'groff' are available via HTTPS and
 anonymous FTP from the host 'ftp.gnu.org' in the directory 'gnu/groff'.
 .
 'groff' has a home page at the GNU Project.
 .
 https://www.gnu.org/software/groff/

 The code below provides extension macros for the 'man' macro
 package.  Care has been taken to make the code portable; groff
 extensions are properly hidden so that all troff implementations can
 use it without changes.
 .
 With groff, this file is sourced by the 'man' macro package itself.
 Man page authors who are concerned about portability might add the
 used macros directly to the prologue of the man page(s).
 .
 Convention: Auxiliary macros and registers start with 'm' followed
 by an uppercase letter or digit.
 .
 Setting the `mG` register to a positive value (e.g., on the command
 line) enables usage of macros defined here that have alternative
 definitions in the main groff man macro file.  This is for testing.
 The logic uses subtraction due to frustrating, AT&T troff-compatible
 limitations on the '!' operator.

 cover sheet. MT files is only for compatibility reasons, and has several
 limits due to that it don't know when the cover starts, and cannot
 change sizes. Use COVER for new coversheet macros.
 .
 But with MT it is possible to write all of the AT&T covers.
 An example can be found in mm/0.MT.
 .
 When writing a new cover using COVER, have in mind that the cover
 should print the page with the COVEND macro. This macro
 should be defined by the new macrofile.
 .
 Here is a part of ms.cov:
 > .\"-----------------
 > .de COVEND
 > .sp |4.2c
 > .cov@print-title
 > .cov@print-authors
 > .cov@print-firm
 > .cov@print-abstract
 > .cov@print-date
 This is important, since COVER disables the page header.
 > .pg@enable-top-trap
 Should begin with page one (normally).
 > .bp 1
 And enable the trap at the page footer.
 > .pg@enable-trap
 > ..

License:   __HEADER___
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
 .
 0. PREAMBLE
 .
 The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
 functional and useful document "free" in the sense of freedom: to
 assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
 with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.
 Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way
 to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible
 for modifications made by others.
 .
 This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
 works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.  It
 complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
 license designed for free software.
 .
 We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
 software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
 program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
 software does.  But this License is not limited to software manuals;
 it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
 whether it is published as a printed book.  We recommend this License
 principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.
 .
 1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS
 .
 This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that
 contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be
 distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice grants a
 world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that
 work under the conditions stated herein.  The "Document", below,
 refers to any such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a
 licensee, and is addressed as "you".  You accept the license if you
 copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission
 under copyright law.
 .
 A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
 Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
 modifications and/or translated into another language.
 .
 A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of
 the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
 publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall
 subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall
 directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document is in
 part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain
 any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical
 connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
 commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
 them.
 .
 The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles
 are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
 that says that the Document is released under this License.  If a
 section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not
 allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may contain zero
 Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify any Invariant
 Sections then there are none.
 .
 The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are listed,
 as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that
 the Document is released under this License.  A Front-Cover Text may
 be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.
 .
 A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
 represented in a format whose specification is available to the
 general public, that is suitable for revising the document
 straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
 pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
 drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or
 for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input
 to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file
 format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart
 or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.
 An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount
 of text.  A copy that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".
 .
 Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
 ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML
 or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple
 HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.  Examples of
 transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG.  Opaque formats
 include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by
 proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or
 processing tools are not generally available, and the
 machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word
 processors for output purposes only.
 .
 The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
 plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
 this License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in
 formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title Page" means
 the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title,
 preceding the beginning of the body of the text.
 .
 The "publisher" means any person or entity that distributes copies of
 the Document to the public.
 .
 A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document whose
 title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following
 text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ stands for a
 specific section name mentioned below, such as "Acknowledgements",
 "Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".)  To "Preserve the Title"
 of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a
 section "Entitled XYZ" according to this definition.
 .
 The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which
 states that this License applies to the Document.  These Warranty
 Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this
 License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
 implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has
 no effect on the meaning of this License.
 .
 2. VERBATIM COPYING
 .
 You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
 commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
 copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
 to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no
 other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use
 technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
 copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept
 compensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough
 number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.
 .
 You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
 you may publicly display copies.
 .
 3. COPYING IN QUANTITY
 .
 If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have
 printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the
 Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the
 copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
 Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on
 the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify
 you as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present
 the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and
 visible.  You may add other material on the covers in addition.
 Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve
 the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated
 as verbatim copying in other respects.
 .
 If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
 legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
 reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
 pages.
 .
 If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
 more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
 copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy
 a computer-network location from which the general network-using
 public has access to download using public-standard network protocols
 a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material.
 If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps,
 when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure
 that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
 location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an
 Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that
 edition to the public.
 .
 It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
 Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to
 give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the
 Document.
 .
 4. MODIFICATIONS
 .
 You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
 the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release
 the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
 Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
 and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy
 of it.  In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:
 .
 A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
 from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions
 (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section
 of the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version
 if the original publisher of that version gives permission.
 B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
 responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified
 Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the
 Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five),
 unless they release you from this requirement.
 C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
 Modified Version, as the publisher.
 D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.
 E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
 adjacent to the other copyright notices.
 F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
 giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the
 terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.
 G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections
 and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.
 H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.
 I. Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title, and add
 to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and
 publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If
 there is no section Entitled "History" in the Document, create one
 stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as
 given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
 Version as stated in the previous sentence.
 J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
 public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise
 the network locations given in the Document for previous versions
 it was based on.  These may be placed in the "History" section.
 You may omit a network location for a work that was published at
 least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
 publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.
 K. For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
 Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all
 the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements
 and/or dedications given therein.
 L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
 unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
 or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.
 M. Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section
 may not be included in the Modified Version.
 N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled "Endorsements"
 or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.
 O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.
 .
 If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
 appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
 copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all
 of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the
 list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice.
 These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.
 .
 You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
 nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
 parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
 been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
 standard.
 .
 You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
 passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list
 of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of
 Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
 through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already
 includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or
 by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,
 you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
 permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.
 .
 The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
 give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
 imply endorsement of any Modified Version.
 .
 5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS
 .
 You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
 License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
 versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
 Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
 list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its
 license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.
 .
 The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
 multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
 copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
 different contents, make the title of each such section unique by
 adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original
 author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number.
 Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of
 Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.
 .
 In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled "History"
 in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled
 "History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled "Acknowledgements",
 and any sections Entitled "Dedications".  You must delete all sections
 Entitled "Endorsements".
 .
 6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS
 .
 You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
 documents released under this License, and replace the individual
 copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
 that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the rules
 of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents in all
 other respects.
 .
 You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
 distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert a
 copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this
 License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that
 document.
 .
 7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS
 .
 A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate
 and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
 distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the copyright
 resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights
 of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit.
 When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not
 apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves
 derivative works of the Document.
 .
 If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
 copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of
 the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on
 covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
 electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form.
 Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole
 aggregate.
 .
 8. TRANSLATION
 .
 Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
 distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.
 Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
 permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
 translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
 original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
 translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
 Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include
 the original English version of this License and the original versions
 of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a disagreement between
 the translation and the original version of this License or a notice
 or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.
 .
 If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements",
 "Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to Preserve
 its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual
 title.
 .
 9. TERMINATION
 .
 You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
 except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
 otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void, and
 will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
 .
 However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license
 from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally,
 unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally
 terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder
 fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to
 60 days after the cessation.
 .
 Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
 reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
 violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
 received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
 copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
 your receipt of the notice.
 .
 Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
 licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
 this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
 reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the same material does
 not give you any rights to use it.
 .
 10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE
 .
 The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the
 GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new versions
 will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in
 detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
 http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.
 .
 Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.
 If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this
 License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of
 following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or
 of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
 Free Software Foundation.  If the Document does not specify a version
 number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not
 as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Document
 specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of this
 License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a
 version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the
 Document.
 .
 11. RELICENSING
 .
 "Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site" (or "MMC Site") means any
 World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also
 provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works.  A
 public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server.  A
 "Massive Multiauthor Collaboration" (or "MMC") contained in the site
 means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC site.
 .
 "CC-BY-SA" means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0
 license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit
 corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco,
 California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license
 published by that same organization.
 .
 "Incorporate" means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or in
 part, as part of another Document.
 .
 An MMC is "eligible for relicensing" if it is licensed under this
 License, and if all works that were first published under this License
 somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently incorporated in whole or
 in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover texts or invariant sections, and
 (2) were thus incorporated prior to November 1, 2008.
 .
 The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the site
 under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1, 2009,
 provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.
 .
 ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents
 .
 To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
 the License in the document and put the following copyright and
 license notices just after the title page:
 .
 Copyright (c)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
 Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
 under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3
 or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
 with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover Texts.
 A copy of the license is included in the section entitled "GNU
 Free Documentation License".
 .
 If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts,
 replace the "with...Texts." line with this:
 .
 with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the
 Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.
 .
 If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
 combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
 situation.
 .
 If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
 recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
 free software license, such as the GNU General Public License,
 to permit their use in free software.

 Modified by jjc@jclark.com as follows: the doc-* files are assumed
 to be installed as mdoc/doc-* rather than tmac.doc-* (the filename
 'tmac.doc-common' would be too long); when using groff, the doc-*
 files are loaded using the 'mso' request.

 IEEE 754 standardized three items:
 - The formats of single-float and double-float - nowadays commonly
 available as 'float' and 'double' in C and C++.
 No autoconf test needed.
 - The overflow and division by zero behaviour: The result are values
 '±Inf' and 'NaN', rather than exceptions as it was before.
 This file provides an autoconf macro for ensuring this behaviour of
 floating-point operations.
 - A set of conditions (overflow, underflow, inexact, etc.) which can
 be configured to trigger an exception.
 This cannot be done in a portable way: it depends on the compiler,
 libc, kernel, and CPU.  No autoconf macro is provided for this.
 .
 Ensure non-trapping behaviour of floating-point overflow and
 floating-point division by zero.
 (For integer overflow, see gcc's -ftrapv option; for integer division by
 zero, see the autoconf macro in intdiv0.m4.)

                     GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                        Version 3, 29 June 2007
 .
  Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>
  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
  of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
 .
                             Preamble
 .
   The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
 software and other kinds of works.
 .
   The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
 to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
 the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
 share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
 software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
 GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
 any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to
 your programs, too.
 .
   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
 price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
 have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
 them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
 want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
 free programs, and that you know you can do these things.
 .
   To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
 these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have
 certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if
 you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.
 .
   For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
 gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
 freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive
 or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they
 know their rights.
 .
   Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
 (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
 giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.
 .
   For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
 that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and
 authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
 changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
 authors of previous versions.
 .
   Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
 modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
 can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of
 protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic
 pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to
 use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we
 have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those
 products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we
 stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions
 of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.
 .
   Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
 States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
 software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to
 avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could
 make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that
 patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.
 .
   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
 modification follow.
 .
                        TERMS AND CONDITIONS
 .
   0. Definitions.
 .
   "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.
 .
   "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
 works, such as semiconductor masks.
 .
   "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
 License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and
 "recipients" may be individuals or organizations.
 .
   To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
 in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
 exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the
 earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.
 .
   A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based
 on the Program.
 .
   To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
 permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
 infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
 computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
 distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
 public, and in some countries other activities as well.
 .
   To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
 parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through
 a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.
 .
   An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"
 to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
 feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
 tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
 extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
 work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If
 the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
 menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.
 .
   1. Source Code.
 .
   The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
 for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source
 form of a work.
 .
   A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official
 standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
 interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
 is widely used among developers working in that language.
 .
   The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other
 than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
 packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
 Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
 Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
 implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A
 "Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component
 (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
 (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
 produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.
 .
   The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all
 the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
 work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
 control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's
 System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
 programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
 which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source
 includes interface definition files associated with source files for
 the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
 linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
 such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
 subprograms and other parts of the work.
 .
   The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users
 can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
 Source.
 .
   The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
 same work.
 .
   2. Basic Permissions.
 .
   All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
 copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
 conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
 permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
 covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
 content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
 rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.
 .
   You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
 convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
 in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
 of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you
 with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
 the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
 not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works
 for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
 and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
 your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.
 .
   Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
 the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
 makes it unnecessary.
 .
   3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.
 .
   No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
 measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
 similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
 measures.
 .
   When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
 circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
 is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to
 the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
 modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's
 users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of
 technological measures.
 .
   4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.
 .
   You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
 receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
 appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
 keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
 non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
 keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
 recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.
 .
   You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
 and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.
 .
   5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.
 .
   You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
 produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
 terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
 .
     a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
     it, and giving a relevant date.
 .
     b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
     released under this License and any conditions added under section
     7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to
     "keep intact all notices".
 .
     c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
     License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
     License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
     additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
     regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no
     permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
     invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.
 .
     d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
     Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
     interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
     work need not make them do so.
 .
   A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
 works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
 and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
 in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
 "aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
 used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users
 beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work
 in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
 parts of the aggregate.
 .
   6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.
 .
   You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
 of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
 machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
 in one of these ways:
 .
     a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
     (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
     Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
     customarily used for software interchange.
 .
     b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
     (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
     written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
     long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
     model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
     copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
     product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical
     medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no
     more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
     conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the
     Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.
 .
     c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
     written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This
     alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and
     only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord
     with subsection 6b.
 .
     d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
     place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
     Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
     further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the
     Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to
     copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
     may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)
     that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
     clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
     Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the
     Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
     available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.
 .
     e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
     you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
     Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
     charge under subsection 6d.
 .
   A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
 from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
 included in conveying the object code work.
 .
   A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any
 tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,
 or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
 into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
 doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular
 product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a
 typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status
 of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user
 actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product
 is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
 commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent
 the only significant mode of use of the product.
 .
   "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,
 procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
 and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from
 a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must
 suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object
 code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
 modification has been made.
 .
   If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
 specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
 part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
 User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
 fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
 Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
 by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply
 if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
 modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has
 been installed in ROM).
 .
   The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
 requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates
 for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for
 the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a
 network may be denied when the modification itself materially and
 adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and
 protocols for communication across the network.
 .
   Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,
 in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
 documented (and with an implementation available to the public in
 source code form), and must require no special password or key for
 unpacking, reading or copying.
 .
   7. Additional Terms.
 .
   "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this
 License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
 Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
 be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
 that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions
 apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
 under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
 this License without regard to the additional permissions.
 .
   When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
 remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
 it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
 removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
 additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
 for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.
 .
   Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
 add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of
 that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:
 .
     a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
     terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or
 .
     b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
     author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
     Notices displayed by works containing it; or
 .
     c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
     requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
     reasonable ways as different from the original version; or
 .
     d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
     authors of the material; or
 .
     e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
     trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or
 .
     f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
     material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of
     it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for
     any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on
     those licensors and authors.
 .
   All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further
 restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you
 received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
 governed by this License along with a term that is a further
 restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains
 a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
 License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
 of that license document, provided that the further restriction does
 not survive such relicensing or conveying.
 .
   If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
 must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
 additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
 where to find the applicable terms.
 .
   Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
 form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
 the above requirements apply either way.
 .
   8. Termination.
 .
   You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
 provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
 modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
 this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
 paragraph of section 11).
 .
   However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
 license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
 provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
 finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
 holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means
 prior to 60 days after the cessation.
 .
   Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
 reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
 violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
 received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
 copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
 your receipt of the notice.
 .
   Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
 licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
 this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
 reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
 material under section 10.
 .
   9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.
 .
   You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
 run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
 occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
 to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,
 nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
 modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do
 not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
 covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.
 .
   10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.
 .
   Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
 receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
 propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible
 for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.
 .
   An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an
 organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
 organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered
 work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
 transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
 licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could
 give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
 Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if
 the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.
 .
   You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
 rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may
 not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
 rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
 (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
 any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
 sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.
 .
   11. Patents.
 .
   A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
 License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The
 work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".
 .
   A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims
 owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
 hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
 by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
 but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
 consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For
 purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant
 patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
 this License.
 .
   Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
 patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
 make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
 propagate the contents of its contributor version.
 .
   In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express
 agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
 (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
 sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a
 party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
 patent against the party.
 .
   If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
 and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
 to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
 publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
 then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
 available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
 patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
 consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
 license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have
 actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
 covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work
 in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
 country that you have reason to believe are valid.
 .
   If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
 arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
 covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
 receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
 or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license
 you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered
 work and works based on it.
 .
   A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within
 the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
 conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are
 specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered
 work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is
 in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment
 to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying
 the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
 parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory
 patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work
 conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily
 for and in connection with specific products or compilations that
 contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,
 or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.
 .
   Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
 any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
 otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.
 .
   12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.
 .
   If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
 otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
 excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a
 covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
 License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
 not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you
 to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey
 the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
 License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.
 .
   13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.
 .
   Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
 permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
 under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single
 combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this
 License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,
 but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,
 section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the
 combination as such.
 .
   14. Revised Versions of this License.
 .
   The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
 the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
 be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
 address new problems or concerns.
 .
   Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
 Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General
 Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the
 option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered
 version or of any later version published by the Free Software
 Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the
 GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published
 by the Free Software Foundation.
 .
   If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
 versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's
 public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you
 to choose that version for the Program.
 .
   Later license versions may give you additional or different
 permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
 author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
 later version.
 .
   15. Disclaimer of Warranty.
 .
   THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
 APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
 HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY
 OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
 THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
 PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
 IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
 ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
 .
   16. Limitation of Liability.
 .
   IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
 WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS
 THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
 GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
 USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
 DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
 PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
 EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
 SUCH DAMAGES.
 .
   17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.
 .
   If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
 above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
 reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
 an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the
 Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a
 copy of the Program in return for a fee.
 .
                      END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
 .
             How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
 .
   If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
 possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
 free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
 .
   To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
 to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
 state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
 the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
 .
     <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
     Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
 .
     This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
     it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
     the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or
     (at your option) any later version.
 .
     This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
     but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
     MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
     GNU General Public License for more details.
 .
     You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
     along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.
 .
 Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
 .
   If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short
 notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:
 .
     <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
     This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
     This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
     under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
 .
 The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
 parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands
 might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an "about box".
 .
   You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,
 if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.
 For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see
 <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.
 .
   The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program
 into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you
 may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with
 the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General
 Public License instead of this License.  But first, please read
 <http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html>.
